# HuemoteControl
In my project I used those Samsung raw codes to control a LED light bulb from China.
Basically I've mapped which control functions from the TV Remove corresponds to the light commands,
then I can just call the function from anywhere outside/inside the house and the IR LED will emmit the 
corresponding waves to control the Light. =)
This is just for study pourpouse, but you can share your opinion about it, oh btw I SUCK at C, so don't
mind any mistakes here xD
